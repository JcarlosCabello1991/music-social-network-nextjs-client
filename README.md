# 🗺 Getting to know the project

## Team Objectives 🎯

- API architecture with the easiest flow for the frontend
- Comfortable user experience

## Organization 📆

To accomplish all of our goals, we have implemented the Scrum Agile Methodology. Every Sprint had its own goal, and each was contained within three weeks. To manage those sprints, we held daily planning and review meetings as well as sprint retrospectives. Using the Kanban structure, we divided our sprints, issues, and tasks on Github Projects. We also implemented a code review system in order to get all the team connected with all parts of the project.

## Team Convention 🤝

Based on Agile methodologies we had daily reviews, sprint plannings and sprint reviews. This was done in order to agree on the requirements, design, develop, test, deploy and review each sprint.
